# About Me

I am Edward(Shiqiu) Liu, a Senior Real Time Rendering Engineer at NVIDIA, where I focus on R&D of graphics and rendering technologies on future SW/HW architectures.

I am interested in real-time and offline rendering, game engine architectures, light transport simulation, image reconstruction and generating cool images with deep learning. Previously I also worked as a Sr. Developer Technology Engineer at NVIDIA, performing low-level optimizations on GPUs and worked on various novel algorithms such as Lens Matched Shading for next-gen GPUs. 

I spent most of my college career at South China University of Technology writing software renderers from scratch. Later I joined the graphics lab at Georgia Institute of Technology as a research assistant, working on fluid simulation and rendering. I also used to be an intern at Microsoft Research Asia and Tencent, where I worked on GPU based video codec and gaming. 

In my spare time, I also like travelling and landscape photography. And here is a video of me getting the [3rd prize of National English Speech Competition in China](http://contest.i21st.cn/article/speaking/1061_1.html).
